# nixpacks.toml
# This file is now minimal. The primary dependency installation logic
# has been moved to railway-unified-build.sh to ensure it runs after
# Nixpacks copies all project files into the build environment.

# No custom phases needed here for now.
# Nixpacks will use its default install and setup providers (e.g., Node.js).
